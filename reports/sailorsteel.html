								<p>I'm only a month into my fountain pen addiction and I'm frantically trying not to buy everything at once. So I've been living vicariously through Reddit and Instagram post new pen days, ink swatches, etc. etc. and one of the most common companies to come up was Sailor. Now, if you're familiar with japanese fountain pens, or fountian pens at all you'll find this obvious. Sailor is known as one of the "big three" japanese pen makers amongst Pilot and Platinum. As a beginner you hear a ton about Sailor's "famous feedback" and "pencil-like feel and sound" but what that actually feels like is a mystery. A mystery that eggs you on to purchase one.
								<br><br>
								Sailor wasn't my first choice out of the three. Pilot is known for having the best bang for their buck (which was extra appealing in my current saving up state) and platinum has great quality control alongside a nice sealing cap. Plus, and this was only at the time, they looked sort of generic--like the emoji for "fountain pen" pulled into real life. But like all collection hobbies, the more I heard about them the more that itch builds up. Pleasently, this pen has impressed well beyond subverting my low expectations.
								<br><br>
								So, here we are. I found a Sailor Steel Nibbed Shiki-ori Hisakata Wakazu in Fine on Amazon for a good price since I didn't have the funds to buy a "real" Sailor Gold Nib. Though, online posts noted that the steel nibs feel roughly the same with <i>maybe</i> more feedback and <i>maybe</i> a bit more stiffness. As I said before, I'm not really experienced enough to validate these claims.
								<br><br>
								The Sailor Shiki-ori is a small pen at around 13.5 cm with a max grip diameter of about 9 mm. It's just barely larger than a Pilot Kakuno and just a hair smaller than a Platinum Preppy. It feels more substantial than the Prera in hand but that might be because of the rattly con-40 aggitators.
